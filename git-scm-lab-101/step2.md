Step 2 - Git Status

When a directory is part of a repository it is called a Working Directory. A working directory contains the latest downloaded version from the repository together with any changes that have yet to be committed. As you're working on a project, all changes are made in this working directory.

You can view which files have changed between your working directory and what's been previously committed to the repository using the command git status.

The output of this command is called the "working tree status".

All files are "untracked" by Git until it's been told otherwise. The details of how is covered in the next step.
